# wavelet-transform-EEG
The following is a guide to Wavelet Transform in EEG data.
In the guide (PDF file) you'll find the following:
- Mathmatical introduction (time frequency duality, wavelets, wavelet transform, convolution and scalograms, uncertainty)
- Continuous, descrete and stationary wavelet transform
- Hybrid methods
- Mother wavelet selection and thresholding
- Code implentation

### Note
This guide was created in a wider effort to explore denoising techniques for building a [robotic arm controlled by EEG](https://github.com/VanniLeonardo/Prosthetic-Arm) singlals. Feel free to use it however you find useful.
